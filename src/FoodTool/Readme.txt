Important 'need to know':
	- Only small dense LDL colesterol (sdLDL-c) is associated with metabolic syntrome.
	  All LDL is not 'bad', even though majority of public information states so.
	  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341753/)
	- sdLDL-c is highly correlated by triglyceride levels
	  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5270205/)
	- The causal relation between triglyceride and sdLDL-c IS NOT DETERMINED (1Q 2020).
	  The assumed sdLDL-c --> triglyceride causality is NOT proven nor even studied.
	  (lack of sources)
	- Starch, sugar and excess calories creates excess triglycerides.
	  (e.g. https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/conversion-carbohydrates-triglycerides-2218.html)
	- Reduction of trans- and saturated fat is not valid by "LDL is bad" argument
	- Trans-fats have anti-cancer properties, and the global reduction of usage of trans
	  and saturated fatty acids might be the partial reason for growing cancer rates.
	- official recommendation of 2-5.8g trans fats and 5-6g saturates fats IS MURDER!
	- waist circumference and body fat percentage is best predictor of MetS
	  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4450687/)
	- Triglycerides are released from cells by glucagon, when the body requires fatty acids as an
	  energy source. Insulin causes triglycerides to be taken back to cells. You have too
	  much triglycerides in your blood when cells cannot absorb any more, e.g. when you
	  have eaten too much.

	----> The root of the problem is excess calories and pharmaceutical industry
		  shamelessly spreading misleading information to sell all sorts of medicine and services:
		    - diabetes medicine
				- diabetes is obviously caused by excess calories
		    - ineffective cancer treatment
				- average cancer is probably caused by the delusional avoidance of trans fats
		    - dementia medicine
				- dementia is associated by excess calories, not fat, but fat is blamed by many

			- causing erucic acid ban
					Eurcic acid actually causes weight loss by releasing triglycerides from cells
					allowing you to eat less and lose weight faster, but if you don't "spend"
					those it will increase sdLDL-c, of course...
					This is banned because it is too healthy for people's stupid habits.
